/************************************** Chapter 1 ********************************************/

continuously compounded interest at a rate r culminates to e^rt

	V(t) = V(0)*e^rt

	pv = V * e^-rt

Interest rate concept:
Theoretically, tying your money up for a longer period of time
allows you to demand a higher rate.
Often, if you want immediate access to your money, you will need to take
a floating interest rate (fluctuates from time to time).

IMPORTANT: The less creditworthy the issuer, the higher the rate of interest they pay

Futures and Forwards

Forward: agreement to buy the asset at some time in future at contractual delivery price
	v(0) = 0
	v(t) = delivery price - underlying asset

Future: standardized contract traded on an exchange
	profit / loss calculated everyday
	money changes hands frequently to cover the loss

NEITHER depend on market expectations at maturity

2 uses: speculating and hedging

Let's say you live in China. 
Your friend will pay you in U.S. dollars 6 months from now.
You know the U.S. dollar will go down.
Buy a USD future. Protect yourself.

No-Arbitrage
 
	F = s(t) * e^r(T-t)	(s is the spot price)

Things to keep in mind with futures:

1) holder needs to store commodities (oil, gold, grain, etc.)
   the buyer needs to compensate the holder, so actual price is
   a little higher than the no-arbitrage price

2) holder can invest FX currencies for a return.
   actual price is lower than no-arbitrage price

3) sometimes the holder of an index fund benefits from dividends
   collecting dividends will drive down actual price


Summary:

We valued futures and forwards with the no-arbitrage principle.
Can we do the same with derivatives?

Derivatives

At Maturity: S is spot price, E is exercise price
	call is worth max(S - E, 0). 
	put is worth  max(E - S, 0).

Higher strike benefits puts, Lower strike benefits calls. 

-----Terms:-----
Premium - amount paid for the contract intially.
Underlying Asset - financial instrument upon which the option is based upon

Strike (Exercise) price - Amount for which the underlying asset can be bought(call) or sold(put).
Expiry - Date on which option can be exercised or cease to exist. (denoted by T)

Intrinsic Value - Payoff recieved if the underlying asset is at its current level when option expires.
Time value - Any value the option has above its intrinsic value. (derived from the uncertainty)

In the money - option has positive intrinsic value. Call price below or Put price above.
At the money - option with close to net-zero intrinsic value. 
Out of the money - no intrinsic value, only time value. Call price above or Put price below.

Long position - positive amount of a quantity owned. your exposure is +
Short position - negative amount of a quantity owned. Many assets can be sold short under time constraints 

---------------

Payoff diagrams

call:	max(S - E, 0)	 __/
put:	max(E - S, 0)	\__

value before expiry depends on two things :
1) what is the asset's price today? 
2) how long is there before expiry?

#2 is a little more subtle. more time to decide is good,
but what about the time value of money? what about the risk free rate?

In general,
	
	V(S, T) = max(S - E, 0)

Anymore parameters we should consider? What about volatility?
So many questions; so little answers. (lol)

side note: out-of-the-money options have high gearing, high leverage. 

buyer:
super high payoff for a small investment, 
but good chance the option will expire worthless and you lose all your money.

writer:
small probable profit, but you have to risk a massive loss. 
makes you think twice about writing the option
Hedge your risk by buying related contracts 

Key concept:
Options have gearing. If you have a strong view of the direction of the market, 
you can exploit derivatives to give you a better return than buying and selling the underlying asset.

------Put-Call Parity----------
Say you buy a call and write a put. payoff is: 
	max(S(T) - E, 0) - max(E - S(T), 0) = S(T) - E
	Plot is a line graph with slope 1, y-intercept = -E

Well, is there another way to get payoff S(T) - E?
buy the asset and borrow some money. 
asset pays off S at time T, and you owe E at time T

Thus,
	C - P = S - E * e^-r(T - t)

A long call and short put gives exactly the same payoff as
a long asset and short cash position.
--------------------------------

Bull and Bear Spreads

First example of an option strategy.

Buy a call with 100 strike and write a call with 120 strike	__/--
payoff:
	0 		for S <= 100 
	S - 100		for 100 < S <= 120
	20		for 120 < S

scaled to max 1 payoff:
	(1/(E2 - E1)) * (max(S - E1, 0) - max(S - E2, 0))

bear spread?
write a put with strike 100 and buy a put with strike 100	--\__

Straddle and Strangle is really cool
good for volatility trading

Straddle : \/
buy a put and call with the same strike price
payoff with a huge breakout or bounce back

Strangle : \_/
same as straddle except biased in one direction
cheaper usually. gearing for out-of-the-money strangle generally higher than that of straddle

both are rarely held until expiry. Again, use to trade volatility

risk reversal. long call short put with a gap  /-/

butterfly and condor:
butterfly has purchase and sale of options with three w. diff strikes __/\__
condor is the same with 4 __/-\__ trapazoid

butterfly ex. long a 90 call, short 2 calls at 100, and buy a call at 110
condor ex. long an 80 call, short a 90 call, short a 110 call, buy a 120 call

Conjecture: with options, cheap is good.

Convertible bond is a bond you can buy from Corporate America.
acts like a bond that pays coupons, but you can convert it to the underlying stock before expiry.


Summary: we know some of the market jargon and understand why people buy / write derivatives. 
We have seen more No-Arbitrage with put-call parity, and we know the price of options are affected by
underlying asset and time to expiry. Just how much risk is really involved? Stay tuned to find out. 
We still don't even know what they are worth.

Example Answers
1)	a) call at E 	  max(E - S, 0) + (S - E) = max(S - E, 0). 	__/
	b) straddle at E  max(S - E, E - S) 	\/
	c) bull spread from e1 to e2	max(S-E1, 0) - max(S-E2, 0) 	_/- 
	d) max(E2 - S, 0) + max(S - E1, 0)
	   case E1 > E2:  strangle from E2 to E1. \_/
	   case E1 = E2:  straddle at E1 = E2 \/
	   case E1 < E2:  strangle from E1 to E2 verticle shifted up  \_/ ^
	e) bear spread +  double short put	max(S - E1, 0) + max(S - E2, 0) - 2*max(E - S, 0) /-/ + -\ + -\
		makes a butterfly at E: _/\_

2) profit diagram factors in the original option premium with a vertical shift downward of the payoff diagram.
   (E - S) + 2*max(S - E, 0)  payoff gives a straddle at E. shift down twice the premium of the option for the profit diagram.

3) C - P = S - E * e^dt    (t = 0.25 and d = 0.05)
   3 - 1.5 <=> 60 - 58 * e^.0125 
   1.5 < 1.27   Arbitrage exists
   Long the call and cash position, short the stock and put.
   
4) butterfly spread is long the max and min calls, short the middle call twice
   long the 80 and 100, short the 90 twice
   p = 11.91 + 1.03 - 2 * 4.52 = $3.90

5)  what I know: C = P + S - E*v, so dC/dE = dP/de - v
    		 C1 - 2C2 + C3 = P1 - 2P2 + P3 + 3S - v(E1 - 2E2 + E3)
    what I looked up:
	for calls, V(E) - V(E+dE) must be > 0 bc of time optionality of call
	as dE -> 0, we get dV/dE < 0
	
	for the butterfly spread,
	V(E - dE) - 2V(E) + V(E + dE) must be > 0 bc butterfly spread is pos within that range (E-dE to E+dE)
	So, d^2V/dE^2 > 0 since dV/dE < 0.

/********************************* Chapter 3 **************************************************/
Binomial Model

think of it as a teaching aid to explain delta-hedging, risk elimination, and risk-neutral valuation.
rely on the binomial model for the intution it gives, not for numerical calculations.
poor model of stock price behavior in practice.

setup:
1) we own a call option that expires tomorrow
2) stock can either rise or fall by a specific amount
3) interest rates are zero %

key example:

say we have a call on the stock for $100 strike
p=0.6 that it will rise to 101 tomorrow, and p=0.4 that it will fall to 99 tomorrow.
what is the option worth today if interest rates are zero? 

Well, if stock is 101 tomorrow, payoff is 1, and it's 0 if the stock falls to 99.
so, $0.60? nope. 

The answer is $0.50.
we need to make a portfolio long a call and short 1/2 the stock to see why that is
     
       S = 101
     / payoff = 1 - 0.5 * 101
   /   p = 0.6

100
today's payoff= ? - 1/2 * 100

   \   p = 0.4
     \ payoff = 0 - 0.5 * 99
       S = 99

in both cases, tomorrow's payoff is -99/2.
interest rates are zero, so today's payoff must also be -99/2

? - 1/2 * 100 = -99/2, 
so ? = 1/2

key concept : value of option DOES NOT depend on the probability of the stock rising or falling
questions:
	1) why should this 'theoretical price' be 'market price'?
	2) how did I know to short 0.5 of the stock for hedging?
	3) how does this change if interest rates are non-zero?


delta hedging
today: ? - x * 100
tomorrow, it's worth either:	1 - x * 101 or 0 - x * 99 and these must be equal to each other
so, 1 - 101x = -99x, and 2x = 1. x = 1/2
in general, x = range of payoff / range of stock prices
think of delta as the sensitivity of the option to changes in the stock. 

what if interest rates are nonzero? multiply by the discount factor to bring tomorrow's value back to present value.
ex. if r = 0.1, multiply by 1 / (1 + 0.1 / 252) 

Real world vs. Risk-Neutral world

in the real world:
	* we know all about risk elimination and delta-hedging.
	* we are very sensitive to risk, and expect greater return for taking risk.
	* turns out, only two stock prices matter for the pricing, not the probabilities.

in the risk neutral world (where people don't care about risk):
	* we don't care about risk and don't expect any extra return for unnecessary risk.
	* we don't ever need statistics for estimating probabilities of events happening.
	* we believe that everything is priced using simple expectations.

Risk-neutral expectations based on probability, although fundamentally wrong,
provide easy ways to get the right answers

p * SH + (1 - p) * SL = ST	SL = stock fall, SH = stock rise, ST = stock today
p * oh + (1 - p) * ol = o	ol = option payoff fall, oh = option payoff rise, o = option today


Now, foundation for the lognormal walk:
stock can rise to uS or fall to vS

  / uS
S
  \ vS
<-dt->

not so fast, time to wean your waf off the model starting now.
instead of using u, v, p we will use mean and standard deviation.
write u, v, and p in terms of drift and volatility

drift μ(mu): average rate at which the asset rises.
volatility σ(sigma): measure of the randomness.

u = 1 + σ(δt)^.5
v = 1 - σ(δt)^.5

p = 0.5 + μ(δt^.5) / 2σ

Let's look at the expected return
expected asset price after a δt time step is:

puS + (1 - p)vS = (1/2 + μ * sqrt(δt) / 2σ)(1 + σ * sqrt(δt)) * S + (1/2 - μ * sqrt(δt) / 2σ)(1 - σ * sqrt(δt)) * S 
                = (1 + μ * δt) * S	expected return is μ * δt

Let's look at the std deviation
variance of change in asset price is:

S^2 * (p(u - 1 - μδt)^2 + (1 - p)(v - 1 - μδt)^2)
= S^2(σ^2δt - (μδt)^2)

standard return of asset changes is approximately σ * sqrt(δt)


-------An equation for the value of an option--------

let's say we know the value of the option at time t+δt
make a portfolio at time t consisting of one option and a short of x in the underlying.
at time t, the portfolio value is

π = V - xS 

let V take on value V+ or V- at t+δt, 
so portfolio takes on value V+ - xuS or V- - xvS

we can hedge it by setting tomorrow's values equal to each other. 
then x = (V+ - V-) / (u-v)S
the value of tomorrow's portfolio will then be π + δπ

for no-arbitrage, δπ = rπ * δt

putting it all together, we get 

π + δπ = π(1 + rδt) = V+ - u(V+ - V-) / (u - v)
with π  = v - xS  = V - (V+ - V-) / (u - v)

so, (1+rδt)(V - (V+ - V-)/(u-v)) = V- - v(V+ - V-)/(u-v)
so, (1+rδt)V = (1+rδt)(V+ - V-)/(u-v) + (uV- - vV+)/(u-v)

if we let p' = 1/2 + r * sqrt(δt) / 2σ,
then V = (p'V+ - (1-p')V-)/(1+rδt).

p' is just p when μ = r. 
p' is the risk-neutral probability. 
p is the real probability 

we can build a binomial tree for the stock price and option prices
if we use S = 100, δt = 1/12, r = 0.1, and σ = 0.2,
then u = 1.0604, v = 0.9431, and p' = 0.5567

The Greeks

greeks are derivatives of the option value with respect to various variables and parameters
important to distinguish between diff w. respect to variable vs. parameter. (or both)
if it's just w. respect to asset price and/or time, we can estimate it from the tree.

delta:
from the binomial model, delta is:
	(V+ - V-) / (u-v)S
in the limit that time approaches 0, delta becomes δV/δS

gamma:
δ²V/δS², and it's the sensitivity of the delta to the asset

theta:
δV/δt, the sensitivity of option price to time, assuming the asset price doesn't change.
estimate as (.5(V+ - V-) - V)/δt

calculating greeks for the parameters is a bit harder
requires a 2nd binomial calculation

vega:
δV/δσ, the sensitivity of the option to volatility
you would need to find the value of the option twice at volatilites σ +- ε
then vega would be (V+ - V-)/2ε

teaser for later: "in the continuous-time limit of the greeks and option values, they converge to the black-scholes equation"

black-scholes equation: 
			
	δV/δt + 0.5(σ²S² * δ²V/δS²) + (rS * δV/δS) - rV = 0


Examples:

1) solve the system of equations for u and v

	p = 1/2				(1)
	pu + (1-p)v = e^μδt		(2)
	pu² + (1-p)v² = e^(2μ+σ²)δt	(3)

substitute v in equation (2) into equation (3).

u+v = 2e^μδt
v = 2e^μδt - u

subbing into (3)
u² + u² - 4ue^μδt + 4e^2μδt = 2e^(2μ+σ²)δt
u² - 2ue^μδt + e^2μδt = e^(2μ+σ²)δt - 1
u - e^μδt = e^μδt * √(e^σ²δt - 1)

finally:
p = 1/2
u = e^μδt * (1 + √(e^σ²δt - 1))
v = e^μδt * (1 - √(e^σ²δt - 1))


2) u = 1 + σ√δt
   v = 1 - σ√δt

Taylor series:

V+ = V + σS√δt*dV/dS + 0.5σ²S²δt*d²V/dS² + δt*dV/dt
V- = V - σS√δt*dV/dS + 0.5σ²S²δt*d²V/dS² + δt*dV/dt

substitute into V = (V+ - V-)/(u-v) + (uV- - vV+)/((u-v)(1+rδt)) 

it ends up simplfying to the Black-Scholes equation: 

δV/δt + 0.5(σ²S² * δ²V/δS²) + (rS * δV/δS) - rV = 0


3) calculate delta (x)

   84 payoff = 5
80<
   76 payoff = 0

x = (5-0)/(84-76) = 5/8

o is the value of the option today

o-80x = -76x     o = 4x = 5/2 = $2.50

by the risk-neutral probability method:

p*84 + (1-p)*76 = 8p + 76 = 80, so p = 1/2 

o = 0.5(5 + 0) = $2.50


4) again, use a binomial tree

r = 2% and E = 90

   98
92<
   86

x = (8 - 0)/(98 - 86) = 8/12 = 2/3

o - 92x = -86x / e^.02   o = (92-86*e^-.02)x = $5.14

by risk-neutral method:
p*98 + (1-p)*86 = 12p + 86 = 92e^.02
p = (92e^.02 - 86)/12 = 0.65488

o = p(8-0)e^-.02 = $5.24*e^-.02 = $5.14

/************************************** Chapter 4 ********************************************/
The Random Behavior of Assets

data analysis and modeling fundamentals. 
Also, Wiener process and intro to Stochastic Calculus

three forms of financial analysis:
* fundamental
* technical
* quantitative

fundamental: try to determine what the company is actually worth.
study the balance sheets, management teams, patent applications, competitors, lawsuits, etc.
can be hard bc it requires accounting, and patience
also, no gaurantee you will make money. (markets can stay irrational longer than you can stay solvent).

technical: opposite of fundamental analysis. looking only at the stock price history, drawing trendlines
and specific patterns, then making predictions. this is usually a load of bologna.

quantitative: our focus for portfolio theory, derivatives pricing, and risk management.
treat the financial quantities (stock prices & interest rates) as random. choose best model for the randomness

Why is randomness even important??
Let's examine Jensen's inequality to find out.
Order in which we do the payoff calculation matters

Say you have a stock at 100. in one year, equal chance of going to 50 or 150.
for a call option at 100,

E[S] = 100 P(E[S]) = 0
E[P(S)] = (50 + 0) / 2 = 25

Payoff(Expected[price]) = 0
Expected[Payoff(price)] = 25

Jensen's Inequality:
E[P(S)] >= P(E[S])  if P(S) is convex. (it is for options)

If we write S = Savg + ε and do a taylor expansion

E[P(S)] = E[P(Savg + ε)] = E[P(Savg) + εP'(Savg) + ε²/2 P''(Savg)]
which is approx. P(E[S] + 1/2P''(E[S])E[ε²]
so left side is approximately greater by 1/2 P''(E[S])E[ε²]
where P''(E[S]) is the convexity of the option. E[ε²] is a measure of it's randomness and variance.

Unpredictability of the asset value plays a large part in financial markets.
Let's examine some returns

Ravg = (ΣRi)/m from i = 1 to M
stdev = sqrt((Σ(Ri - Ravg)²)/(M-1)) from i = 1 to M

On short timescales, you tend to see a lot of noise in the price, and will have to wait months perhaps to spot the trend.
 
 Ri = (Si+1 - Si)/Si = mean + stddev * φ
