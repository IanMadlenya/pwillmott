continuously compounded interest at a rate r culminates to e^rt

	V(t) = V(0)*e^rt

	pv = V * e^-rt

Interest rate concept:
Theoretically, tying your money up for a longer period of time
allows you to demand a higher rate.
Often, if you want immediate access to your money, you will need to take
a floating interest rate (fluctuates from time to time).

IMPORTANT: The less creditworthy the issuer, the higher the rate of interest they pay

Futures and Forwards

Forward: agreement to buy the asset at some time in future at contractual delivery price
	v(0) = 0
	v(t) = delivery price - underlying asset

Future: standardized contract traded on an exchange
	profit / loss calculated everyday
	money changes hands frequently to cover the loss

NEITHER depend on market expectations at maturity

2 uses: speculating and hedging

Let's say you live in China. 
Your friend will pay you in U.S. dollars 6 months from now.
You know the U.S. dollar will go down.
Buy a USD future. Protect yourself.

No-Arbitrage
 
	F = s(t) * e^r(T-t)	(s is the spot price)

Things to keep in mind with futures:

1) holder needs to store commodities (oil, gold, grain, etc.)
   the buyer needs to compensate the holder, so actual price is
   a little higher than the no-arbitrage price

2) holder can invest FX currencies for a return.
   actual price is lower than no-arbitrage price

3) sometimes the holder of an index fund benefits from dividends
   collecting dividends will drive down actual price


Summary:

We valued futures and forwards with the no-arbitrage principle.
Can we do the same with derivatives?

Derivatives

At Maturity: S is spot price, E is exercise price
	call is worth max(S - E, 0). 
	put is worth  max(E - S, 0).

Higher strike benefits puts, Lower strike benefits calls. 

-----Terms:-----
Premium - amount paid for the contract intially.
Underlying Asset - financial instrument upon which the option is based upon

Strike (Exercise) price - Amount for which the underlying asset can be bought(call) or sold(put).
Expiry - Date on which option can be exercised or cease to exist. (denoted by T)

Intrinsic Value - Payoff recieved if the underlying asset is at its current level when option expires.
Time value - Any value the option has above its intrinsic value. (derived from the uncertainty)

In the money - option has positive intrinsic value. Call price below or Put price above.
At the money - option with close to net-zero intrinsic value. 
Out of the money - no intrinsic value, only time value. Call price above or Put price below.

Long position - positive amount of a quantity owned. your exposure is +
Short position - negative amount of a quantity owned. Many assets can be sold short under time constraints

Payoff diagrams

call:	max(S - E, 0)	 __/
put:	max(E - S, 0)	\__

value before expiry depends on two things :
1) what is the asset's price today? 
2) how long is there before expiry?

#2 is a little more subtle. more time to decide is good,
but what about the time value of money? what about the risk free rate?

In general,
	
	V(S, T) = max(S - E, 0)

Anymore parameters we should consider? What about volatility?
So many questions; so little answers. (lol)

side note: out-of-the-money options have high gearing, high leverage. 

buyer:
super high payoff for a small investment, 
but good chance the option will expire worthless and you lose all your money.

writer:
small probable profit, but you have to risk a massive loss. 
makes you think twice about writing the option
Hedge your risk by buying related contracts 

Key concept:
Options have gearing. If you have a strong view of the direction of the market, 
you can exploit derivatives to give you a better return than buying and selling the underlying asset.

------Put-Call Parity----------
Say you buy a call and write a put. payoff is: 
	max(S(T) - E, 0) - max(E - S(T), 0) = S(T) - E
	Plot is a line graph with slope 1, y-intercept = -E

Well, is there another way to get payoff S(T) - E?
buy the asset and borrow some money. 
asset pays off S at time T, and you owe E at time T

Thus,
	C - P = S - E * e^-r(T - t)

A long call and short put gives exactly the same payoff as
a long asset and short cash position.
--------------------------------

Bull and Bear Spreads

First example of an option strategy.

Buy a call with 100 strike and write a call with 120 strike	__/--
payoff:
	0 		for S <= 100 
	S - 100		for 100 < S <= 120
	20		for 120 < S

scaled to max 1 payoff:
	(1/(E2 - E1)) * (max(S - E1, 0) - max(S - E2, 0))

bear spread?
write a put with strike 100 and buy a put with strike 100	--\__

Straddle and Strangle is really cool
good for volatility trading

Straddle : \/
buy a put and call with the same strike price
payoff with a huge breakout or bounce back

Strangle : \_/
same as straddle except biased in one direction
cheaper usually. gearing for out-of-the-money strangle generally higher than that of straddle

both are rarely held until expiry. Again, use to trade volatility

risk reversal. long call short put with a gap  /-/

butterfly and condor:
butterfly has purchase and sale of options with three w. diff strikes __/\__
condor is the same with 4 __/-\__ trapazoid

butterfly ex. long a 90 call, short 2 calls at 100, and buy a call at 110
condor ex. long an 80 call, short a 90 call, short a 110 call, buy a 120 call

Conjecture: with options, cheap is good.

Convertible bond is a bond you can buy from Corporate America.
acts like a bond that pays coupons, but you can convert it to the underlying stock before expiry.


Summary: we know some of the market jargon and understand why people buy / write derivatives. 
We have seen more No-Arbitrage with put-call parity, and we know the price of options are affected by
underlying asset and time to expiry. Just how much risk is really involved? Stay tuned to find out. 
We still don't even know what they are worth.
