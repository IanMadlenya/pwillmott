continuously compounded interest at a rate r culminates to e^rt

	V(t) = V(0)*e^rt

	pv = V * e^-rt

Interest rate concept:
Theoretically, tying your money up for a longer period of time
allows you to demand a higher rate.
Often, if you want immediate access to your money, you will need to take
a floating interest rate (fluctuates from time to time).

IMPORTANT: The less creditworthy the issuer, the higher the rate of interest they pay

Futures and Forwards

Forward: agreement to buy the asset at some time in future at contractual delivery price
	v(0) = 0
	v(t) = delivery price - underlying asset

Future: standardized contract traded on an exchange
	profit / loss calculated everyday
	money changes hands frequently to cover the loss

NEITHER depend on market expectations at maturity

2 uses: speculating and hedging

Let's say you live in China. 
Your friend will pay you in U.S. dollars 6 months from now.
You know the U.S. dollar will go down.
Buy a USD future. Protect yourself.

No-Arbitrage
 
	F = s(t) * e^r(T-t)	(s is the spot price)

Things to keep in mind with futures:

1) holder needs to store commodities (oil, gold, grain, etc.)
   the buyer needs to compensate the holder, so actual price is
   a little higher than the no-arbitrage price

2) holder can invest FX currencies for a return.
   actual price is lower than no-arbitrage price

3) sometimes the holder of an index fund benefits from dividends
   collecting dividends will drive down actual price


Summary:

We valued futures and forwards with the no-arbitrage principle.
Can we do the same with derivatives?
